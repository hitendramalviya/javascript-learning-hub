Assignment on control flow using `if` and `switch` statements in JavaScript:

1. Create a variable called `age` and assign it a value of 25.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, log "You are an adult" to the console. If it's not, log "You are not an adult" to the console.
3. Create a variable called `dayOfWeek` and assign it a string value of "Monday".
4. Use a `switch` statement to check the value of `dayOfWeek`. If it's "Monday", log "It's Monday today". If it's "Tuesday", log "It's Tuesday today". If it's "Wednesday", log "It's Wednesday today". If it's none of these values, log "It's not Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday today" to the console.
