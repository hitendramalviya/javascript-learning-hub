Assignment on operators in JavaScript:

1. Create a variable called `num1` and assign it a value of 10.
2. Create a variable called `num2` and assign it a value of 5.
3. Create a variable called `num3` and assign it a value of 3.
4. Create a variable called `num4` and assign it a value of 2.
5. Create a variable called `result1` and assign it the value of `num1` plus `num2`.
6. Create a variable called `result2` and assign it the value of `num1` minus `num2`.
7. Create a variable called `result3` and assign it the value of `num1` multiplied by `num3`.
8. Create a variable called `result4` and assign it the value of `num1` divided by `num4`.
9. Create a variable called `result5` and assign it the value of `num1` modulo `num4`.
10. Create a variable called `result6` and assign it the value of `num2` incremented by 1 using the pre-increment operator.
11. Create a variable called `result7` and assign it the value of `num3` decremented by 1 using the post-decrement operator.
12. Create a variable called `result8` and assign it the value of `num1` compared to `num2` using the greater than operator.
13. Create a variable called `result9` and assign it the value of `num1` compared to `num2` using the less than or equal to operator.
14. Create a variable called `result10` and assign it the value of `num2` compared to `num3` using the strict equality operator.
